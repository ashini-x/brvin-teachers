# Repository Guide — Coordinating BRVIN Teachers and BRVIN Core

**Last reviewed:** 8 November 2026  
**Application repository:** ashini-x/brvin-teachers  
**Core repository:** ashini-x/parmar-ai

## 1. Why there are two repositories

The repositories represent separate product and trust boundaries, not two copies of one codebase.

| Concern | Owner |
|---|---|
| BRVIN Teachers tenant, student, channel and session identities | brvin-teachers |
| Teacher profiles, configuration and feature entitlements | brvin-teachers |
| Application AI orchestration and final answer | brvin-teachers |
| Shared teaching modules and channel adapters | brvin-teachers |
| BRVIN Teachers Operator Console | brvin-teachers |
| Teacher knowledge projects, collections and source registry | BRVIN in parmar-ai |
| PDF ingestion, private storage, OCR, indexing and readiness | BRVIN in parmar-ai |
| Application/environment registration and app-project grants | BRVIN in parmar-ai |
| Private retrieval, quotas, audit and connection proof | BRVIN in parmar-ai |
| Existing Parmar AI, Fatman and AskMoina production behavior | parmar-ai |

BRVIN Teachers is a downstream consumer of BRVIN v2. It is not a BRVIN subsystem or a replacement for Parmar AI.

## 2. Mandatory reading order for a new session

### In this repository

1. AGENTS.md
2. README.md
3. docs/REPOSITORY_GUIDE.md
4. docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
5. docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md
6. docs/IDENTIFIER_POLICY.md when working on tenant, project, collection or source identity/reference handling.
7. docs/OPERATOR_CONSOLE_DESIGN.md when working on the Operator Console, tenant workspace, admin UX or BRVIN management handoff.
8. docs/BRVIN_MANAGEMENT_INTEGRATION.md when implementing classroom, collection, source, upload, Core management or cross-repository handoff.
9. The relevant contract, security, operations or decision document.
10. docs/BRVIN_RETRIEVAL_PROVIDER_COMPATIBILITY.md for any Core retrieval provider, indexing, source-progress UI or v2 consumer compatibility work.

### In ashini-x/parmar-ai

1. docs/BRVIN_2_MASTER_PLAN.md — canonical current BRVIN state and continuation.
2. docs/BRVIN_2_PRODUCT_SCOPE_AND_FINAL_MILESTONES.md — approved BRVIN scope and milestone acceptance.
3. docs/BRVIN_SYSTEM_REFERENCE.md — as-built infrastructure and trust boundaries.
4. docs/BRVIN_2_RPC_V2_CONTRACT.md — frozen v2 contract.
5. docs/BRVIN_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md — same-account consumer setup and verification.
6. docs/BRVIN_2_ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md — accepted core decisions.
7. docs/BRVIN_ADMIN_RUNBOOK.md when registering BRVIN Teachers application/environment or operating knowledge ingestion.
8. The relevant BRVIN admin or operations runbook.

The master plan identifies the canonical active references. If a link or path changes, inspect the current documentation index rather than reviving old milestone drafts or superseded proposals.

## 3. Rules for cross-repository changes

A normal BRVIN Teachers feature should stay in this repository.

A cross-repository change is required only when the feature depends on a BRVIN-owned contract or capability that does not already exist. In that case:

1. Identify the missing capability and why the existing contract cannot satisfy it.
2. Inspect the current implementation and frozen contract in parmar-ai.
3. Propose the smallest backward-compatible BRVIN change.
4. Implement and test the BRVIN change in a separate branch/PR in parmar-ai.
5. Coordinate the consumer update in this repository against the exact contract revision.
6. Validate both sides, including authorization, failure and revocation behavior.
7. Update the canonical docs in both repositories.
8. Deploy in the sequence required by the compatibility plan; do not deploy an incompatible consumer first.

Never use a BRVIN core change as a shortcut for missing tenant authorization in the consumer. BRVIN app-project grants are application-wide; this application must still enforce the authenticated student's server-side tenant/project mapping.

For the approved provider migration, use the Core plan [BRVIN_RETRIEVAL_PROVIDER_MIGRATION.md](https://github.com/ashini-x/parmar-ai/blob/main/docs/BRVIN_RETRIEVAL_PROVIDER_MIGRATION.md) as the backend source of truth and this repository's [BRVIN_RETRIEVAL_PROVIDER_COMPATIBILITY.md](BRVIN_RETRIEVAL_PROVIDER_COMPATIBILITY.md) for UI/consumer acceptance. The unified retrieval target includes theory, formulas, worked examples and numerical problems in one math-aware hybrid path. Do not start consumer-side Qdrant, Vertex, embedding or formula-indexing integration. Core M13 PR #147 is merged; its production provider remains AI Search and its optional corpus-manifest writer is default-off. Core M14 foundation/backfill/operator PRs #148, #149 and #152 are merged. The staging operator Worker is deployed at `https://parmar-ai-m14-staging.thenewtongs.workers.dev` with a separate one-source APAC D1 database. It is waiting for the owner's private GCS bucket and staging GCP secrets before the original Vision backfill can run; Vertex and Qdrant provisioning follow later. These changes are Core-internal and require no consumer code or deployment. Keep the BRVIN Teachers v2 binding/typed connector and current Operator Console unchanged unless a later, separately reviewed contract change requires coordination.

## 4. Session handoff and status discipline

At the start of every session, establish:
- current commit and branch in both repositories;
- whether there are uncommitted changes or open PRs relevant to the task;
- latest CI and production deployment status;
- exact task and acceptance criteria;
- which repository is expected to change.

After each accepted change, update documentation in the same PR. The top-level README should remain a concise current index, not an append-only diary.

Do not infer that an implementation is deployed because it exists on main; do not infer that deployment is healthy because CI passed. Record code, CI, deployment and production verification separately.

## 6. Current management handoff

Consumer PR #2 and Core PR #107 are merged and deployed; consumer PR #4 / release #42174893189 deployed tenant-scoped project/retrieval helpers and the content-free probe. BRVIN Admin registered the active `brvin-teachers` Production environment. Consumer PR #5 / release #42181732210 deployed both private Service Bindings with the generated trusted environment ID and pinned BRVIN connector; the one-time proof is accepted. Consumer PR #8 / release #42403048998 deployed the persistent five-stage source progress stepper using the existing tenant-scoped Core status RPC; CI, Worker deployment, health and Access-protection smoke checks passed. The live consumer version is `c22a6d72-8f34-4a2e-95e4-c8876071e6ee` (deployment `1d8a4fcd-1a49-4189-98ee-41fd66885f7b`). The existing teacher profile is real; do not create duplicates. The registered Physics source is still failed pending the separate OCR-output investigation; the stepper does not itself repair or re-run that source. No student channel/model/authentication flow exists yet. Read [BRVIN_MANAGEMENT_INTEGRATION.md](BRVIN_MANAGEMENT_INTEGRATION.md) and [BRVIN_V2_INTEGRATION.md](BRVIN_V2_INTEGRATION.md) before changing either side.
